OpenCV
Open CV stands for “Open source Computer Vision”. It is a library of algorithms which are pre-defined ready to use mainly for computer vision applications like object detection, face detection, people/vehicle counting, biometric recognition etc. Open CV has made it easier for the new AI recognition systems to adopt previous models frameworks. The adopted frameworks can be used unchanged or with minor modifications hence, saving the time to make a similar code again. Open CV was created using C++ and can be used with many languages like Java, MATLAB, C++, Python. [8]

Python is considered the best language for using with Open CV for creation of programmes based on target detection:
i.	Python is supported with dictionary
ii.	Simple OOPs (Object Oriented Programming system)
iii.	Python has an open and a free source
iv.	It is easily readable and programmable
v.	Zero-based numbering is used in python
vi.	Python’s one module can be embedded with many functions [8]
